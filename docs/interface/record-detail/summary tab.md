title: Summary Tab
---

The Summary tab is the first thing you see when opening a record. Every field is displayed as a labeled card — clean, readable, and organized by the layout you choose.

## What Leads the Page

The record's own content is at the top, under its own heading. The framework's
bookkeeping — `Id`, `Created At`, `Edited At`, `Created By`, `Edited By` — is collected
into a collapsed **Record details** section instead.

That ordering is the point. Those five fields used to come first, because that is the
order the model's metadata arrives in, which meant the most valuable rows on screen
described the plumbing and the record's own content began below the fold. They are
demoted, not hidden: open **Record details** and they are all there.

## Field Cards

Each field gets its own card with a label and value. Fields are rendered intelligently based on their type:

| Field Type | How It's Displayed |
|---|---|
| **Text** | Plain text with line wrapping |
| **Number** | Formatted with locale-appropriate separators |
| **Date / DateTime** | Human-readable format (e.g., "Mar 4, 2026, 12:30 PM") |
| **Boolean** | Visual indicator (✓ / ✗) |
| **Foreign Key** | Linked name of the related record, clickable |
| **JSON** | Formatted, expandable view |

## Column Layout

Not all records have the same number of fields. Use the **column toggle** in the toolbar to switch between:

- **1 column** — full-width cards, one per row; best for records with few fields or long text values
- **2 columns** — balanced layout; the default, works well for most models
- **3 columns** — compact layout; best for models with many short fields (IDs, dates, amounts)

> [!example]- 🎬 Video — Column layout toggle
> <video controls width="100%">
>   <source src="../../videos/record-column-toggle.mp4" type="video/mp4">
> </video>
> Click the column toggle to switch between 1, 2, and 3 columns, see the layout reflow.

The column setting is preserved in the URL, so you can share a link to a record with a specific layout — your colleague sees the same thing you do.

## Serializer Presets

The **View Preset** dropdown in the toolbar lets you switch which fields are visible. Each serializer preset defines a different set of fields — think of them as different lenses on the same record.

For example:
- **Default** — all fields
- **Detail** — key fields with additional computed properties
- **Summary** — just the essentials (name, status, amount)

Your developer defines these presets via [[features/data-pipeline/serializers|serializers]]. As a user, you just pick the view that fits your task.


## Export to PDF

Click the **PDF** button in the toolbar to generate a PDF of the Summary tab. The export captures all visible field cards in their current layout — ready for filing, emailing, or printing.

This is especially useful for:
- Compliance records that need to be archived
- Sharing a single record with someone who doesn't have access to the application
- Including in audit documentation

> [!tip]
> The PDF export uses the currently selected serializer preset, so switch to the view you want before exporting.

## Editing

Click the **Edit** button in the toolbar to switch to the edit form. All editable fields become input fields — text boxes, dropdowns, date pickers — pre-populated with the current values. Fields you don't have [[features/access-and-ui/permissions|permission]] to modify appear as read-only.

After saving, you return to the Summary tab with the updated values reflected immediately.

### File fields

A file field shows the current attachment with controls to work with it:

- **Download** the existing file, or **replace** it by choosing a new one.
- **Remove** it by clearing the field and saving — the attachment is deleted and the field
  is left empty. (Leaving a file field untouched keeps the current file; only an explicit
  remove or replace changes it.)
