`CalculatedModelMixin` extends [[reference/LexModel Internals|LexModel]] with a **combination engine** — it generates, deduplicates, clusters, and dispatches model instances from a cartesian product of defining fields. It's the base class for any model that needs to produce many records from dimensional combinations.

```python
from lex.core.mixins.CalculatedModelMixin import CalculatedModelMixin
```

For the conceptual guide with examples and patterns, see [[features/processing/batch calculations]].

## Class Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `defining_fields` | `List[str]` | `[]` | Field names that form the combination axes. A `UniqueConstraint` is created automatically. |
| `parallelizable_fields` | `List[str]` | `[]` | Subset of `defining_fields` used to group models for Celery dispatch. |
| `input` | `bool` | `False` | Whether this model accepts external input data. |

## Required Methods

### `get_selected_key_list(key: str) → list`

Returns the possible values for a single defining field. Called once per field during combination generation.

```python
def get_selected_key_list(self, key: str) -> list:
    if key == 'region':
        return list(Region.objects.all())
    if key == 'product':
        return list(Product.objects.filter(active=True))
    return []
```

**Important:** By the time a field is expanded, all fields listed *before* it in `defining_fields` are already set on `self`. This lets you filter dependent fields (e.g., awards belonging to the current upload).

### `calculate()`

Business logic for one combination. Same contract as `CalculationModel.calculate()` — don't call `self.save()`, the framework handles it (without bumping `edited_by` / `edited_at` during calculation-triggered saves).

## The `create()` Classmethod

```python
MyBatchModel.create(**kwargs)
```

Orchestrates the four-step pipeline:

### Step 1 — `ModelCombinationGenerator`

Expands `defining_fields` into the cartesian product. For each field:
1. Check if `kwargs` contains an override → use it
2. Otherwise call `get_selected_key_list(field_name)` on the current model instance
3. Deep-copy the model for each value and set the field

Fields with overrides are processed **first** to reduce the search space early.

### Step 2 — Duplicate Handling

For each generated instance, queries the database for existing records matching all `defining_fields`:

| Matches | Action |
|---|---|
| 0 | Insert — primary key is reset for a fresh record |
| 1 | Update — reuses the existing record's primary key |
| > 1 | Error — data integrity violation |

This makes `create()` **idempotent**.

### Step 3 — `ModelClusterManager`

Groups models into processing batches based on `parallelizable_fields`:

```python
# parallelizable_fields = ['region']
# Produces:
{'US': [m1, m2, m3], 'EU': [m4, m5], 'APAC': [m6, m7, m8]}
# Flattened to: [[m1,m2,m3], [m4,m5], [m6,m7,m8]]
```

If `parallelizable_fields` is empty, all models go into a single group.

### Step 4 — Dispatch

Checks `CELERY_ACTIVE` environment variable and whether `calculate()` has a `.delay()` attribute:

- **Celery path:** `CeleryTaskDispatcher.dispatch_calculation_groups()` sends each group as a `calc_and_save.delay()` call inside a `WaitForTasks` context, then waits for completion.
- **Sync path:** `calc_and_save_sync()` processes all models sequentially — calls `lex_func()` then `save()` on each. `None` models are skipped. The path is **fail-fast**: the first model whose `calculate()` or `save()` raises immediately aborts the batch with `CalculatedModelError` (wrapping the underlying error with `model_class` / `model_index` / `total_models` context). Earlier successful saves are not rolled back by the helper itself, so wrap the trigger in a transaction if you need all-or-nothing semantics.

In both paths, the framework sets logging context for the currently executing child model automatically.

Failed Celery *dispatch* (the broker is unreachable, or a single group's `.delay()` call fails) falls back to synchronous processing. A calculation error raised *inside* a task does not fall back — it aborts the batch.

## The `CalculatedModelMixinMeta` Metaclass

The custom metaclass does one important thing: it reads `defining_fields` and creates a [`UniqueConstraint`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ref/models/constraints/#uniqueconstraint) on those fields automatically. This enforces at the database level that no two records can have the same combination of defining field values.

```python
# Automatically generated:
class Meta:
    constraints = [
        UniqueConstraint(fields=['upload', 'award'], name='defining_fields_MyModel')
    ]
```

## Method Resolution: `lex_func()`

`CalculatedModelMixin` supports both `calculate()` and `calculate_mixin()` as override targets. The `lex_func()` method resolves which one to call:

1. If `calculate_mixin()` is overridden → use it
2. Otherwise if `calculate()` is overridden → use it
3. Otherwise → `NotImplementedError`

In practice, always override `calculate()`. The `calculate_mixin()` path exists for internal framework use.

## Inherited Features

Since `CalculatedModelMixin` extends `LexModel`, your batch models also get:

- `created_by` / `edited_by` tracking
- `pre_validation()` / `post_validation()` hooks
- All `permission_*()` methods
- Full [[features/tracking/bitemporal history|bitemporal history]] (unless listed in `untracked_models`)

## Error Hierarchy

The framework provides specific exception types for each stage:

| Exception | When |
|---|---|
| `ModelCombinationError` | Field expansion fails — bad field name, empty values, `get_selected_key_list()` error |
| `ModelClusteringError` | Clustering fails — invalid parallelizable field, grouping error |
| `CeleryDispatchError` | Celery dispatch fails (triggers automatic sync fallback) |
| `CalculatedModelError` | General error during the pipeline |

## Quick Reference

```python
from lex.core.mixins.CalculatedModelMixin import CalculatedModelMixin

class MyBatchModel(CalculatedModelMixin):
    # Dimensions
    defining_fields = ['upload', 'item']
    parallelizable_fields = ['upload']

    # Fields
    upload = models.ForeignKey('Upload', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    item = models.ForeignKey('Item', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    result = models.FloatField()

    # Values for each dimension
    def get_selected_key_list(self, key: str) -> list:
        if key == 'item':
            return list(Item.objects.filter(upload=self.upload))

    # Business logic per combination
    def calculate(self):
        self.result = compute(self.upload, self.item)

# Generate all combinations
MyBatchModel.create()

# Generate with overrides
MyBatchModel.create(upload=[specific_upload])
```
