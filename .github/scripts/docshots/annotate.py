"""Turn a `Shot` plus captions into an annotated, animated SVG.

One renderer for both capture front-ends. A terminal shot draws its own text;
a browser shot embeds a PNG; from there the callout geometry is identical, so
a CLI walkthrough and a UI walkthrough look like the same document.

Output is a single self-contained `.svg` file, meant to be referenced from
markdown the ordinary way:

    ![Running the test groups](../images/cli/pytest-groups.svg)

That matters for the docs site: Quartz strips raw HTML from markdown, but an
`<img>` pointing at an SVG file renders, and CSS animation inside that file
still runs — so the arrows draw themselves without the site needing to know
anything about it.

Colour does NOT come from the reader's theme. `prefers-color-scheme` inside an
`<img>`-loaded SVG is not reliably delivered (measured: Chromium renders both
schemes identically, even with the SVG loaded as the document), so each figure
declares the surface that matches what it is showing and the page behind it
stays transparent.
