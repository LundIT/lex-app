"""
Per-test descriptions for the showcase report.

The catalogue is intentionally split out of ``showcase_clusters.py`` so
that file stays a clean dataclass + structural definition while the
written prose lives here. Each map is keyed by the unittest method
name only (the ``test_X_Y_…`` part) — the same key the runner extracts
from Django's verbose output, and the same key the report builder
looks up in ``cluster.test_descriptions``.

Style guide
-----------
* One sentence each. Two if a contrast genuinely matters.
* Lead with the customer-visible behaviour, not the implementation.
  ✓  "Returns 400 with the field name when a required field is missing."
  ✗  "Calls _validate_required on the serializer's Meta.required."
* Avoid framework jargon (``LIFO stack``, ``ContextResolver``, ``pgcode``)
  — those belong in engineering docs, not the platform health email.
* Skip implementation details that are noise to a stakeholder; keep
  the answer to "what does this prove the platform can still do?".

Coverage status (5 May 2026)
----------------------------
* celery_async, validation_hooks — covered in ``showcase_clusters.py``
  (kept inline; populated first as the gate-critical clusters).
* permissions, signals_ws, exports, serializers, queries, crud_api —
  covered here.
* init — the CLI-contract scenarios (sub-cluster 1m) are covered here;
  the rest of the cluster still falls back.
* Other clusters (calculations, history, audit_logging, api_layer,
  stress) fall back to a generic "engineering: add a description in
  this file" line in the report.

# ── crud_api ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This cluster is about the REST API contract for records: POST /create,

# pagination/ordering/filtering surface used directly via the API.
#
# Distinguish from ``queries`` (below) — that cluster is about the AG
# Grid filter/sort/group/pivot translation, i.e. the query DSL used by
# the frontend grid, not the basic REST CRUD shape.
