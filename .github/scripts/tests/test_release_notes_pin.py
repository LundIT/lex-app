"""Tests for the frontend version spec — what a release says it ships.

`frontend-version.txt` holds an exact version or `latest`. An exact version is
the provenance record: it names one published artifact and is readable from the
tag. `latest` is not — it resolved to whatever was newest on build day, which
the tag does not record — so it must report as a gap rather than a guess.
