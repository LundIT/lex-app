"""Catch-up pass for future-dated bitemporal activations.

Why this exists
---------------
Saving a history row with a future ``valid_from`` schedules its own activation:
:func:`lex.core.services.bitemporal_signals._schedule_future_activation` writes a
timer and marks the meta record ``SCHEDULED``. Which timer depends on the
deployment:

* ``CELERY_ACTIVE=true`` — a ``ClockedSchedule`` + one-off ``PeriodicTask`` row,
  fired by a per-instance ``django-celery-beat`` pod;
* otherwise — an in-process ``sched`` entry held by a daemon thread
  (:class:`~lex.process_admin.utils.local_scheduler.LocalSchedulerBackend`).

**Both timers are volatile, and the second one is lost on every restart.**
Nothing rehydrates the in-process queue, so a deploy, node move or OOM silently
drops every pending activation on that instance; the meta rows stay
``SCHEDULED`` forever and the data never becomes current. No error is raised.
The beat timer survives restarts, but only by keeping an always-on pod per
instance whose sole remaining job is holding a clock.

The durable fact is not the timer — it is the meta row. ``SCHEDULED`` plus the
history row's ``valid_from`` states exactly what should already have happened.
This module reads that and finishes the job.

That inverts the failure model. A timer that never fires becomes a *latency*
problem rather than a silent data-loss one, because this pass converges on the
same result. It is what makes it safe to retire per-instance beat, and what
makes any future cluster-level scheduler an optimisation that is allowed to
fail rather than a component every instance depends on.

Safety
------
Running this repeatedly, or concurrently with a timer firing the same
activation, is safe by construction:

* ``BitemporalSynchronizer.sync_record_for_model`` is convergent — it derives
  the main-table row from whichever history record is currently valid, so two
  runs produce one result;
* ``activate_history_version`` re-checks ``valid_from`` and refuses to act
  early;
* the ``SCHEDULED -> DONE`` transition is a no-op on repeat.

Deliberately **not** dispatched to Celery. Activation is a small convergent
write, not a calculation, and running it in-process means this works
identically on instances that have no broker at all — which is most of them.
