"""Widget specs and the manifest that carries them.

Pure on purpose: no Streamlit import, no I/O, no globals. Manifest construction
is where the fiddly validation lives -- unknown option, missing pk, a widget id
reused -- and that should be testable without a Streamlit runtime or a browser.

Validation rejects loudly rather than dropping. A widget silently absent from a
page because a key was misspelled is the failure that costs an afternoon: the
page renders, nothing errors, and the widget is simply not there.
