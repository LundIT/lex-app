"""The Streamlit surface of lex-app.

Everything a dashboard author needs is importable from here::

    from lex.lex_app.streamlit import lex_view, lex_calculation, lex_widgets

One rule decides which name to reach for, and it is the shape of the call rather
than anything to memorise:

* ``lex_view(path)`` embeds one lex-app **route** -- a table, a form, a detail page;
* ``lex_calculation(...)`` and its siblings embed one lex-app **control**;
* ``lex_widgets()`` embeds **several controls** into a single iframe.

A flat ``lex_*`` function is always exactly one thing. The block form is the
optimisation you reach for once a page has several, and it exists for that
reason alone.
