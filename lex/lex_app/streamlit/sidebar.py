"""The Streamlit sidebar's chrome, in lex-app's visual language.

Scope, deliberately narrow: this owns the CONTAINER -- a brand lockup, who is
signed in, the hairlines between them, and the log-out row. It renders nothing
navigational. Whatever ``streamlit_structure.main()`` puts in the sidebar is the
author's, and is neither styled nor reordered here.

That boundary is also what keeps this robust. Every element below is markup we
emit ourselves with inline styles, so nothing depends on Streamlit's own DOM:
no ``[data-testid=...]`` selectors, no class names that a Streamlit upgrade can
rename underneath us. The one thing we do not attempt is true bottom-pinning,
which would need exactly those selectors -- the log-out row is last in call
order, which puts it at the bottom of the sidebar without touching Streamlit's
layout at all.

Colours come from the vendored design tokens rather than being retyped, so the
sidebar cannot drift from the product it is imitating. The surface is navy in
BOTH light and dark modes, matching lex-app, where the sidenav is deliberately
mode-invariant.
