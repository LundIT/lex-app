"""Streamlit's asset bundle is public, cheap to fetch, and still fenced off from everything else.

Intent: Streamlit's frontend is code-split. Version 1.61 ships 365 JS chunks and
names 107 of them in eager ``<link rel="modulepreload">`` tags, so a single page
load is over a hundred asset requests. The proxy in front of it authenticated
every request via one catch-all route, which turned that fan-out into the
framework's three loudest bug reports at once: a flood of 401s in the server
log; a cold start that transferred 1.77 MB of plaintext because the decoded body
forced ``Content-Encoding`` to be stripped; and -- the one customers saw --
``TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module`` in the browser,
because a *lazily* imported chunk that 401s has no other way to surface. Vite
reports an HTTP failure on a dynamic ``import()`` as a type error, so an expired
credential reached the user as a type error in code they never wrote.

The bundle is therefore served by the proxy itself and never gated. What makes
that safe is that it is package content from the installed wheel -- identical
for every install, no tenant data, no identity -- and the reason it must stay
narrow is that everything *else* on the same host is exactly the opposite. So
the boundary scenarios below matter as much as the public ones: the moment
``/media/**`` or the WebSocket stops requiring a credential, this change has
turned a performance fix into a data leak.

A regression is not subtle in either direction. Gate the bundle again and the
TypeErrors come back; un-gate one path too many and a dashboard is readable by
anyone who knows the URL.
