"""Intent: a widget an author asked for must render, or say why it did not.

The failure this file prevents is the silent one -- a widget missing from a
dashboard because an option was misspelled, with a page that renders cleanly and
nothing in the logs. Validation therefore raises at the ``page.calculation(...)``
call site, where the traceback points at the line the author wrote.

Also pins the contract that makes the design worth having: one host render per
page regardless of widget count, and status envelopes routed back to the widget
that produced them.
