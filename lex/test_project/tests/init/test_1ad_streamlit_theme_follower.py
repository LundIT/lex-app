"""Intent: a theme change in lex-app must reach Streamlit, and must not misfire.

Streamlit's theme is boot-time configuration, so a page can only follow a change
by reloading. That makes the cost of a wrong decision high -- a needless reload
discards whatever the user had typed -- and the cost of a missed one merely
cosmetic. These tests pin the decisions on the Python side of that trade:

* what a URL is asking for, including the forms Streamlit does not document;
* that "asking for nothing" is distinguishable from "asking for light", because
  the first must not trigger a reload and the second may;
* that the storage key has exactly one definition, since the relay in proxy.py
  and the follower here silently stop talking if it drifts;
* that the emitted script reaches its host through ``parent`` rather than
  ``top``, which throws when lex-app embeds Streamlit cross-origin.

Not covered here: the emitted script's runtime behaviour. It was exercised
against DOM doubles during development -- seven cases: follows a real change,
no-ops when already correct, preserves ``embed`` and unrelated ``embed_options``,
refuses to act on an unmeasurable background, reloads once under an event burst,
ignores a garbage mode. That harness needs a JS runtime, which this repository
does not have, so it is not in CI. The batch note records the gap.

        Reported as: "sometimes it doesn't detect the switch. I reload it then it

        The relay writes the agreed key only when the value CHANGES -- correct on
        its own terms, since an unchanged write wakes every tab for nothing. But
        it means a page that has DRIFTED from the agreement can never be told to

        agreed on, which by definition never arrives.

        A reload fixed it because install reads the value directly instead of
        waiting to be told -- which is the whole shape of the bug: conforming to
        a value we already hold does not require an event.

        So it re-reads on return to the page. ``focus`` is the one that matters:
        two windows open side by side never change visibility when you alt-tab
        between them, and that is exactly how these products are used.
        ``visibilitychange`` covers a genuinely backgrounded tab, and a Streamlit
        rerun is taken as a free third opportunity.

        option gets opened".

        1. **Opening the menu is a TOGGLE.** A second drive starting while the
           first still had it open closed it again, so neither found its item and
           both sat until the timeout. Drives are now serialised, and a request
           arriving mid-drive is queued rather than started, latest wins.

        2. **The close step toggled blindly.** It clicked the button whenever it
           wanted the menu shut -- including when the popover had already
           dismissed itself, which re-opened it, and the mask came off on a timer
           regardless. That is the menu the user saw. It now asks with Escape,
           which cannot re-open, and reveals only once the popover is actually
           gone rather than after a fixed delay.

        3. **`currentMode()` is stale while a drive is open**, because Streamlit
           has not re-rendered yet. Comparing against it dropped genuine changes
           as "already right": firing light/dark/light/dark back to back, every
           intermediate request matched the not-yet-updated mode and never
           reached the queue, so the page settled on whichever mode was
           mid-flight instead of the one asked for last. That is the drift, and
           it is the one that survived fixing the other two.
