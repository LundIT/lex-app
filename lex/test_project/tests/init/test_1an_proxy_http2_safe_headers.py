"""A proxied response must be legal over HTTP/2, not merely accepted over HTTP/1.1.

Intent: the auth proxy relays Streamlit's responses, and in production those
responses reach the browser over HTTP/2 through an intermediary. HTTP/1.1 is
forgiving about several things HTTP/2 is not, so a response that looks fine in
local development can be rejected outright in production -- and the rejection
arrives as a stream reset, which the browser reports as
``net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`` against a status that was already ``200``.

That is how this was reported: clicking a download started it, the browser sat
at 0 bytes, and it ended in a network error -- while the proxy's own log showed
nothing but ``GET /media/....pdf -> 200``. Three separate defects combined:

* ``Date`` and ``Server`` were forwarded from the upstream, so uvicorn's own
  copies made them duplicates. Both are singleton fields (RFC 9110 5.5.2) and a
  duplicated singleton is a protocol violation.
* ``Content-Length`` was dropped from every proxied response, forcing
  ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked`` -- which HTTP/2 forbids outright
  (RFC 9113 8.2.2) -- and denying the browser any idea of how big the download
  was, hence "0 bytes" with no progress.
* GZip was applied app-wide, so already-compressed payloads (a PDF, a ZIP) were
  re-compressed for nothing on a loop this process shares with the Streamlit
  script runner.

          Content-Length`, and the client sees `http=200 bytes=0`. That is the

        * a stale **encoding** raises `DecodingError: incorrect header check` in the
          client, which tries to gunzip bytes httpx already decoded.
