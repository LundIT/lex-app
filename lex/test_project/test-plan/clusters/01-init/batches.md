## Cluster 1 — Init / Project Bootstrap (existing 1a–1n + new 1o)

> **Renumbering note (May 12):** the plan's original placeholder names (1d/1e/1f) collided with sub-clusters that already shipped (1d–1n exist). The next free letter is **1o**, the next free scenario ID is **1.110**. Future batches in this cluster: **1p**, **1q**, **1r**.

### Batch 1o — Lazy imports + sync-exclusion + history-config helpers ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.110 – 1.124 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/process_admin/__init__.py`, `lex/lex_app/__init__.py`, `lex/lex_app/keycloak_exclusions.py`, `lex/lex_app/simple_history_config.py` |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1o_lazy_imports_and_helpers.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01o_ProcessAdminLazyGetattr`, `TestCluster01o_KeycloakExclusions`, `TestCluster01o_SimpleHistoryConfig`, `TestCluster01o_LexAppPackageAlias` |
| Fixtures | none (synthetic models built with `type()` + `types.SimpleNamespace`) |
| Tests landed | **15 pass / 0 fail in 0.001s** |
| Coverage gain | +0.4 % (estimated; measured on next coverage run) |
| Status |  Complete (Session 53 — May 12) |

### Batch 1p — Settings / config / URLs / top-level views ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.125 – 1.146 |
| Type | U + I |
| Files covered | `lex/lex_app/settings.py`, `lex/lex_app/urls.py`, `lex/lex_app/views.py`, `lex/utilities/config/generic_app_config.py`, `lex/core/config.py` |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1p_settings_urls_views.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01p_SettingsConstants`, `TestCluster01p_UrlConfResolves`, `TestCluster01p_HealthEndpoint`, `TestCluster01p_LexProjectConfig`, `TestCluster01p_GenericAppConfigHelpers` |
| Fixtures | `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory` for `lex_config.py` writing; no new models |
| Tests landed | **22 pass / 0 fail in 0.016s** |
| Coverage gain | +0.6 % (estimated; measured on next coverage run) |
| Status |  Complete (Session 54 — May 12). Note: `lex/lex_app/apps.py` AppConfig.ready surface deferred to **1q** — it requires real bootstrap fixtures. |

### Batch 1q — Migration file completeness release gate ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.147 – 1.147 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/lex_app/migrations/*.py`, `lex/authentication/migrations/*.py`, `lex/audit_logging/migrations/*.py`, `lex/legacy_data/migrations/*.py` |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1q_migration_files_complete.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01q_MigrationFilesComplete` |
| Fixtures | none |
| Tests landed | **1 pass / 0 fail in 2.42s** |
| Coverage gain | n/a (release-gate drift test) |
| Status | ✅ Complete (Session 70 — June 2) |

### Batch 1s — Log-noise cleanup + lex-namespace debug control (EXC-1787) ✅

> **Letter note (June 8):** letter **1r** was already taken on disk by an in-flight,
> untracked batch (`test_1r_lex_view_embed_helper.py`, Streamlit `lex_view` embed
> helper, scenarios up to 1.158) that is not yet documented in this plan. Per the
> never-renumber rule, this batch took the next free letter **1s** and the next free
> scenario ID after 1.158 → **1.159**.

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.159 – 1.168 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/lex_app/settings.py` (urllib3 `InsecureRequestWarning` suppression gate `LEX_SUPPRESS_INSECURE_WARNING`; new `LEX_LOG_LEVEL` + `lex` logger entry; `CONSOLE_HANDLER_LEVEL` = `min(CONSOLE_LEVEL, LEX_LOG_LEVEL)` derivation; blanket `LEX_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS` → `warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")` gate) |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1s_log_cleanup_and_lex_debug.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01s_InsecureWarningSuppression` (1.159 default-suppressed, 1.160 opt-out honoured, 1.161 opt-out case-insensitive), `TestCluster01s_LexNamespaceDebugLevel` (1.162 lex logger defaults INFO + propagate False, 1.163 `LEX_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` raises lex only while root stays INFO, 1.164 console handler drops to DEBUG for lex, 1.165 console handler stays INFO by default), `TestCluster01s_BlanketWarningSuppression` (1.166 default installs `filterwarnings("ignore")`, 1.167 opt-out skips it, 1.168 opt-out case-insensitive) |
| Fixtures | none (reloads `lex.lex_app.settings` under patched `os.environ`; `sentry_sdk.init` mocked across reloads; env restored in cleanup) |
| Tests landed | **10 pass / 0 fail in 0.26s** |
| Coverage gain | negligible (settings is import-time; pins env-var-driven branches) |
| Status | ✅ Complete (Session 75 — June 8) |

### Batch 1t — `DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS` placement (production cursor crash) ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.169 – 1.170 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/lex_app/settings.py` (the flag was declared at module level, where Django ignores it; moved into each PostgreSQL `DATABASES` alias config dict — the only place `connection.settings_dict` reads it — so server-side cursors are actually disabled behind the `cloud-sql-proxy`/pgbouncer transaction-pooling proxy that otherwise causes `InvalidCursorName` on every `.iterator()`) |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1t_disable_server_side_cursors.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01t_DisableServerSideCursors` (1.169 every Postgres alias carries the flag in its config dict, 1.170 the live `connections["default"].settings_dict` honours it on Postgres / engine-gated for SQLite) |
| Fixtures | none (introspects `settings.DATABASES` + `django.db.connections`) |
| Tests landed | **2 pass / 0 fail in 0.09s** |
| Coverage gain | negligible (settings is import-time; pins a config-placement contract) |
| Status | ✅ Complete (Session 78 — June 9) |

### Batch 1u — Fast ASGI health/readiness probes (coverage task #620) ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.171 – 1.175 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/lex_app/fast_health.py`, `lex/lex_app/asgi.py` |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1u_fast_health_asgi.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01u_FastHealthAsgi` (1.171 path helpers separate liveness/readiness, 1.172 health app drains request body and returns static Healthy payload, 1.173 readiness returns 200/503 based on DB readiness seam, 1.174 top-level HTTP ASGI app short-circuits probe paths before Django, 1.175 non-probe HTTP delegates to Django) |
| Fixtures | none — ASGI `receive`/`send` callables and `AsyncMock` seams only |
| Tests landed | **5 pass / 0 fail** (direct pytest) |
| Coverage gain | `fast_health.py` path helpers + health/readiness ASGI apps; `asgi.py` `http_application` health/readiness/Django routing branches |
| Status | ✅ Complete (Session 81 — June 18). `python -m lex pytest ...` blocked locally by no PostgreSQL service; pure U tests pass with `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=lex_app.settings python -m pytest ...`. |

---

### Batch 1x — Health exposes encrypted runtime metadata for the Instance Controller ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.187 – 1.194 |
| Type | U + I |
| Files covered | `lex/lex_app/runtime_health.py`, `lex/lex_app/fast_health.py`, `lex/lex_app/views.py` |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1x_runtime_health_metadata.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01x_RuntimeHealthMetadata` (1.187 missing key → legacy payload, 1.188 deployed pod adds encrypted runtime token, 1.189 token is ciphertext not plaintext, 1.190 wrong key can't decrypt, 1.191 encryption failure never breaks health, 1.192 Django health route uses runtime payload, 1.193 fast ASGI health route uses runtime payload, 1.194 missing COMMIT_SHA marked unknown) |
| Fixtures | none — Fernet round-trip + `patch.dict` env seams |
| Status | ✅ Complete. **Renumbered 2026-07-07 (BUG-023):** this file previously shared letter `1u` and IDs 1.171–1.175 with `test_1u_fast_health_asgi.py`; moved to fresh letter `x` + fresh IDs 1.187–1.194 (old 1.171→1.187 … 1.178→1.194). No logic change. |

---

### Batch 1v — `TIME_ZONE`↔`USE_TZ` coupling for `django_celery_beat` DatabaseScheduler ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.179 – 1.183 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/lex_app/settings.py` (USE_TZ↔TIME_ZONE coupling); guards the `django_celery_beat` `is_due` path |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1v_scheduler_tz_invariant.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01v_TimezoneInvariant` (1.179 `USE_TZ=False ⟹ TIME_ZONE=="UTC"`, 1.180 `timezone.now()` naive frame within seconds of real UTC, 1.181 recovery `IntervalSchedule` due in live frame via `ModelEntry.is_due` replica, 1.182 future-edit `clocked(now+30s)` ~30s away not hours + past due, 1.183 naive-UTC round-trips exact vs naive-Berlin misread ≥3600s) |
| Fixtures | none — `celery.schedules.schedule` / `django_celery_beat.clockedschedule.clocked` against `lex.lex_app.celery.app` |
| Tests landed | **5 pass / 0 fail** (direct pytest) |
| Coverage gain | settings-level `TIME_ZONE` coupling under `USE_TZ=False`; pins the `maybe_make_aware` naive-as-UTC read for both the recovery interval sweep and future-edit clocked schedule |
| Status | ✅ Complete (Session 84 — June 26). Regression: history+init+settings 63 pass / 1 skip; celery_async+audit_logging 262 pass / 4 skip / 1 xfail. |

---

### Batch 1w — `LEX_TASK_RECOVERY_ENABLED` defaults OFF (stuck calc resets on restart) ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.184 – 1.186 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/lex_app/settings.py` (`LEX_TASK_RECOVERY_ENABLED` default flipped `true` → `false`) |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1w_recovery_default_deployment_target.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01w_RecoveryDefaultOff` (1.184 env unset ⟹ `False`; 1.185 explicit `=true` ⟹ `True` opt-in; 1.186 explicit `=false` ⟹ `False` + case-insensitive `TRUE` ⟹ `True`) |
| Fixtures | none — env-patch + `importlib.reload(lex.lex_app.settings)` harness (mirrors 1s), `sentry_sdk.init` mocked per reload |
| Tests landed | **3 pass / 0 fail** (direct pytest) |
| Coverage gain | settings-level recovery master-switch default resolution |
| Status | ✅ Complete (Session 90 — July 1). Default OFF keeps the startup sweep in blind-abort mode so a stuck `IN_PROGRESS` row is reset on restart when no recovery-supervisor pod runs (local/CI/un-provisioned deploys); prod opts back in explicitly. Verified nested-dispatch untouched: 7j/7q/8ab all pass. Pre-existing unrelated `test_15d` logging-chain failures reproduce identically with the old `=true` default. |

---

---

### Batch 1i — `rebase_incident_datetimes` maintenance command ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.195 – 1.200 |
| Type | E |
| Files covered | `lex/lex_app/management/commands/rebase_incident_datetimes.py` (new) |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1i_rebase_incident_datetimes.py` |
| Test model | `lex/test_project/tests/init/models.py` → `IncidentDatetimeItem` (user `event_at` + managed `created_at`/`edited_at`) |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01i_RebaseIncidentDatetimes` (1.195 `--apply` re-anchors in-window value & spares `created_at`; 1.196 dry-run writes nothing; 1.197 **pre-upgrade** row untouched — late-upgrader safety; 1.198 **post-fix** row untouched — window upper bound; 1.199 **DST-aware** winter value shifts −1h not −2h; 1.200 **DST-transition** value flagged for review) |
| Fixtures | none — seeds rows via `.update()` to stamp `created_at`/`event_at` directly |
| Tests landed | **6 pass / 0 fail** |
| Coverage gain | incident data-migration command (dry-run/apply, per-instance `[--cutoff, --until)` window, app-stamped exclusion, ambiguous-row + DST-transition reporting, DST-aware correction) |
| Status | ✅ Complete — ships with the `USE_TZ=True` cutover. Corrects only user-entered datetimes created in the **per-instance** window `[--cutoff, --until)` — `--cutoff` (that instance's rc212 upgrade) is **required**, no global default, because too-early over-corrects correct pre-upgrade rows; `--until` (that instance's aware-UTC fix, default now) stops post-fix correct rows being re-shifted. Framework-managed timestamps and out-of-window rows are provably left alone. PostgreSQL-only (`AT TIME ZONE`); not idempotent (run once per instance). |

---

---

### Batch 1r — Fetched datetimes return in the DB-session display zone ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.201 – 1.202 |
| Type | I |
| Files covered | `lex/lex_app/settings.py` (`DATABASES['default']['TIME_ZONE'] = TIME_ZONE`, Postgres-guarded) |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1r_fetched_datetime_zone.py` |
| Test model | reuses `IncidentDatetimeItem` (`event_at`) |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01r_FetchedDatetimeZone` (1.201 fetched value carries the display-zone offset & preserves the instant; 1.202 Berlin wall-clock reads 11:00 with no `localtime()`) |
| Fixtures | none |
| Tests landed | **2 pass / 0 fail** (stable over repeated runs) |
| Coverage gain | DB-session display zone on reads (the zero-refactor fix for UTC-looking `str()`/labels) |
| Status | ✅ Complete — running the Postgres session in `TIME_ZONE` makes every fetched `DateTimeField` come back aware-Berlin (`11:00+02:00`) instead of UTC, so `str()`, `.date()`, `.hour`, and model `__str__` render local **with no per-field or per-model changes** — storage stays UTC, instant unchanged. Django's date-part lookups inject an explicit `AT TIME ZONE`, so bitemporal/`as_of` raw SQL is unaffected (verified: history + serializers + init + exports **385 pass** with it live; calc/audit/crud/api **457 pass**, the one api_layer failure is a pre-existing ordering artifact that passes in isolation with or without this change). |

---

### Batch 1y — IDE-aware setup run configurations ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.203 – 1.210 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `generate_pycharm_configs.py`, `lex/bin/lex.py`, `pyproject.toml` |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1y_ide_run_configs.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01y_IdeRunConfigurations` |
| Fixtures | `tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`, Click `CliRunner`, controlled IDE environment markers; no database models |
| Tests landed | **8 pass / 0 fail, 10 subtests pass**; setup regression (`1a` + `1m`) **13 pass / 0 fail, 9 subtests pass** |
| Coverage gain | n/a — scaffolding module is outside configured `source = lex` and `lex/bin/lex.py` is explicitly omitted; tests pin IDE selection/fallback, VS Code parity, JSONC merge, idempotency, and setup output paths |
| Status | ✅ Complete — clear VS Code/PyCharm sessions generate their native format; unknown or conflicting sessions generate both; existing VS Code entries survive regeneration. See [2026-07-23 session](../../progress/sessions/2026-07-23-ide-run-configs.md). |

### Batch 1z — Streamlit auth proxy: iframe re-auth breakout (refused-to-connect fix) ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.211 – 1.216 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/proxy.py` (`_unauthenticated_response`, `_is_iframe_document_request`) |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1z_proxy_iframe_breakout.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01z_ProxyIframeBreakout` (1.211 iframe → 401 frame-breakout not IdP redirect, 1.212 `<frame>` also breaks out, 1.213 top-level HTML still redirects to `/auth/login`, 1.214 no `Sec-Fetch-*` keeps redirect, 1.215 non-HTML → 401 JSON, 1.216 `_is_iframe_document_request` case-insensitive + scoped) |
| Fixtures | none — minimal ASGI `Request` builder + `patch.object(proxy, "PUBLIC_URL", "")` |
| Tests landed | **6 pass / 0 fail** (`python -m lex pytest`) |
| Coverage gain | proxy deny-branch routing: `Sec-Fetch-Dest: iframe`/`frame` document loads break out to a top-level login instead of redirecting the frame into Keycloak's un-frameable login page (`frame-ancestors 'self'` → "refused to connect"); the top-level redirect and API-401 paths stay unchanged |
| Status | ✅ Complete (2026-07-21). Root cause: the embedded `auth_token` session is stored with no refresh token (`refresh_token: None`), so it dies at the 4h Keycloak SSO cap and the deny branch then redirected the iframe document to the IdP. Follow-up (separate change): give the embed path a refresh token for silent renewal. |

---

---

### Batch 1aa — Embedded Streamlit token renewal ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.217 – 1.222 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/authentication/views/token_views.py` (`StreamlitTokenView.post`, `_access_token_expiry`), `lex/proxy.py` (`_persist_jwt_to_session_if_needed`) |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1aa_embedded_token_renewal.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01aa_EmbeddedTokenRenewal` |
| Fixtures | none (fake session dicts + an in-memory token store) |
| Est. tests | 6 |
| Coverage gain | the renewal path of the embedded Streamlit auth flow |
| Prereqs | batch 1z (the breakout response this reacts to) |
| Status | ✅ Complete — 6 pass / 0 fail |
| Note | the breakout batch made the expiry a graceful re-login; this removes the re-login. Two defects had to be fixed for renewal to be possible at all: the token endpoint never published an expiry (the only code returning one, `_generate_new_token`, is unreachable **and** self-signs HS256, which the RS256/JWKS proxy would reject), and `_persist_jwt_to_session_if_needed` returned early whenever the stored token was still valid — so a token renewed *before* expiry, which is the only time renewal can arrive, was discarded and the session died at the original deadline anyway. 1.220 is the gate on that second one: it fails against the pre-fix proxy. A refresh token was deliberately **not** given to the embedded path — it would have to travel through the iframe URL into access logs, history and `Referer` headers. |

---

### Batch 1ab — Ignored client-role self-cleanup (`client-admin` platform role, LEX-5) ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.223 – 1.229 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/lex_app/management/commands/init.py` (`IGNORED_CLIENT_ROLES`, `strip_ignored_role_policies`, `delete_stale_ignored_role_policies`) |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1ab_ignored_role_policy_cleanup.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01ab_IgnoredClientRolesSet` (1.223 ignore-set contents: `client-admin` in, `release-manager` gone), `TestCluster01ab_StripIgnoredRolePolicies` (1.224 stale `Policy - client-admin` removed from `auth_config`; 1.225 reference detached from a permission's `applyPolicies`, order preserved; 1.226 no-op when nothing stale), `TestCluster01ab_DeleteStaleIgnoredRolePolicies` (1.227 live delete by id via `get_client_authz_policies`/`delete_client_authz_policy`; 1.228 no-op when nothing live; 1.229 missing-id fail-fast, mirrors `delete_resources_individual`'s permission-id check) |
| Fixtures | `_make_sync_manager` (stubbed `kc_manager`, same pattern as cluster 1e/1g) |
| Tests landed | **7 pass / 0 fail** |
| Coverage gain | the LEX-5 admin-role-separation self-cleanup: `client-admin` replaces the abandoned `release-manager` in `IGNORED_CLIENT_ROLES`; a policy minted by an older lex-app for a now-ignored role is stripped from the in-memory `auth_config` (and detached from any permission's `applyPolicies`) before re-import, then deleted live from Keycloak once nothing references it |
| Status | ✅ Complete. Design: `local_wiki/projects/admin-role-separation-5/README.md`. The sync only ever ADDS `Policy - <role>` entries via Keycloak's `/authz/resource-server/import` endpoint (verified against the existing `ensure_client_role_policies`/`sync_standard_client_role_permissions` pattern — it never deletes what's absent from a re-imported payload), so the live delete of the stale policy is a separate step, run **after** `import_authorization_settings` succeeds so the detached `applyPolicies` reference has already landed in Keycloak and the policy-delete's referential-integrity check passes. Not independently verified against a live Keycloak instance (no cluster access from this change) — the live-delete ordering assumption is grounded in Keycloak's documented policy/permission referential-integrity behavior, not an in-repo test. |

### Batch 1ac — Streamlit session survival across an idle period ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.230 – 1.246 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/proxy.py` (`internal_token`, `proxy` + `ws_proxy` credential precedence, `_jwt_user_payload`, `_session_user_payload`), `lex/streamlit_app.py` (`_adopt_header_token`, `_sync_tokens_from_headers`, `_pull_token_from_proxy`, `renew_access_token`, `authenticate_from_proxy_or_jwt`, `sync_keycloak_context_from_access_token`, `_token_refresher`, `start_token_refresh_thread_if_needed`, `_within_renewal_grace`), `lex/bin/lex.py` (`streamlit` — mints the shared secret) |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1ac_streamlit_session_survival.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01ac_ProxyRenewalChannel` (1.230–1.235, 1.246), `TestCluster01ac_StreamlitTokenLifecycle` (1.236–1.245) |
| Fixtures | none — Starlette `TestClient` over the real `proxy.app`, a hand-signed SessionMiddleware cookie, capturing stand-ins for the HTTP and WebSocket upstreams, and a dict-backed `st.session_state` |
| Tests landed | **17 pass / 0 fail**; whole `init` cluster **315 pass / 13 skip, 87 subtests pass** |
| Coverage gain | the renewal path of a *running* dashboard, which had none: the pull endpoint and its secret guard, credential precedence on both the HTTP and WebSocket paths, and the Streamlit-side token lifecycle including the identity/expiry split |
| Prereqs | batches 1z (breakout) and 1aa (embedded renewal) — same auth path |
| Status | ✅ Complete — 14 of 17 scenarios fail against the pre-fix tree (the two pre-existing correct behaviours, 1.235 and 1.237, are kept as guards) |
| Note | Root cause was a lifetime mismatch nobody had named: `st.context.headers` is the handshake request, frozen for the life of a socket that Streamlit keeps open for hours, while the access token it carries lives minutes. Session auth then had local refresh *deliberately* disabled on the reasoning that the proxy manages it — true of the proxy's own traffic, but the proxy can only deliver a credential at handshake time, so nothing renewed the running script's copy. Three secondary defects compounded it: `auth_callback` sets `st_access` on every login and the cookie was consulted before the session, so a normal login reached Streamlit as `jwt` with `refresh_token: None`; `_sync_tokens_from_headers` adopted the header token on mere inequality, reverting each renewal on the next rerun; and the expiry path called `_invalidate_local_auth`, wiping identity and rendering "Missing user information" about headers that were present — sticky, because the next rerun re-read the same frozen headers. Renewal now pulls from the proxy, so the refresh token still has exactly one writer. |

### Batch 1ad — Streamlit's asset bundle served ungated, and session durability ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 1.247 – 1.292 |
| Type | U |
| Files covered | `lex/proxy.py` (`_streamlit_static_dir`, `_build_static_routes`, `_apply_asset_cache_headers`, `_assert_static_bundle_present`, `PUBLIC_PROXY_PATHS`, `public_proxy`, `_get_upstream_client`, `_upstream_send`, `_iter_upstream`, `_build_proxied_response`, `_ensure_jwks_ready`, `_fetch_jwks_blocking`, `_get_jwks`, `_safe_next_path`, `_login_path`, `_login_url`, `_current_relative_path`, `_query_without_auth_token`, `_is_document_request`, `login`, `auth_callback`, `proxy`, and the `SESSION_SECRET` / `SESSION_SAMESITE` / `_build_token_store` startup guards), `lex/bin/lex.py` (`streamlit` launch args, `_warn_if_sessions_are_not_durable`) |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1ad_proxy_assets_and_session_durability.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster01ad_PublicAssetBundle` (1.247–1.251), `TestCluster01ad_AuthBoundary` (1.252–1.255), `TestCluster01ad_UpstreamForwarding` (1.256–1.259), `TestCluster01ad_JwksResilience` (1.260–1.263), `TestCluster01ad_LoginReturnPath` (1.264–1.267), `TestCluster01ad_BootstrapTokenHygiene` (1.268–1.269), `TestCluster01ad_SessionDurabilityGuards` (1.270–1.274), `TestCluster01ad_LaunchConfiguration` (1.275–1.276), `TestCluster01ad_ForwardingHardening` (1.277–1.282), `TestCluster01ad_StartupHardening` (1.283–1.286), `TestCluster01ad_RenewalDelivery` (1.287–1.292) |
| Fixtures | none — Starlette `TestClient` over the real `proxy.app`, a streaming stub (`_RawStream`) over the `_upstream_send` seam, and `_reimport_proxy_with` to exercise import-time guards |
| Tests landed | **46 pass / 0 fail**, 33 subtests |
| Coverage gain | the asset path, which had none: what is public, what stays gated, and what the proxy does to a response on the way back. Plus the JWKS availability path, the login return path, and every startup guard |
| Prereqs | batches 1z (breakout), 1aa (embedded renewal), 1ac (idle survival) — same auth path |
| Status | ✅ Complete — **27 of the first 30 fail against the pre-fix tree**. The three that pass (1.254 the authenticated boundary, 1.255 the WebSocket deny, 1.271 the permitted configurations still boot) are deliberate guards: they assert behaviour this change must *not* alter, and would be the first things to break if the public allowlist ever widened |
| Note | The three reports that prompted this — "session timeout resets my state", "starting Streamlit takes forever", "TypeErrors coming out of nowhere" — are one causal chain, and the arithmetic is the explanation. Streamlit 1.61 ships **365** JS chunks and names **107** in eager `modulepreload` tags, and the proxy authenticated all of them through a single catch-all whose deny happened before it looked at the path. So one credential-less moment is a hundred simultaneous 401s; a *lazily* imported chunk that 401s surfaces as `TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module` because Vite's dynamic `import()` has no other vocabulary for an HTTP error (hence `DownloadButton` and `DataFrame`, both lazy chunks, in the screenshots); and stripping `Content-Encoding` — which the old code had to do, having read the *decoded* body — inflated the eager set to 1.77 MB where 0.42 MB was enough. Two further defects had the same shape: `_get_jwks_sync` fetched inline with a **sync** client on the event loop *and* returned `None` on failure while holding valid keys, so one Keycloak blip after the hourly TTL lapse rejected every token in the cluster; and `SESSION_SECRET`/`TOKEN_STORE` both defaulted to per-process values, making a restart or a second replica indistinguishable from an expiry. Measured and explicitly **not** a cause: JWT validation at 0.045 ms/request, 16 ms across all 365 chunks. |

#### 1ad follow-up — scenarios 1.277–1.286

An adversarial review of the first pass (three independent finder angles over `lex/proxy.py`, `lex/bin/lex.py` and the React shell) found **ten further defects in the fix itself**, and these scenarios pin each one. Worth recording because the pattern repeats: every one lived in the *new* code, and four of them would have reproduced one of the three original symptoms by a different route.

| Scenario | Defect it pins |
| --- | --- |
| 1.277 | the `auth_token` strip redirect set only the session cookie, so it handed over **fewer** credentials than the response it replaced — fatal wherever the frame cannot use that cookie (Safari ITP, third-party blocking), which is exactly the deployment the change targets |
| 1.278 | a bodiless 304 yielded `b""`, which reaches GZipMiddleware as a body, skips its `minimum_size` guard, and gets a gzip header attached — uvicorn then raises "Response content longer than Content-Length". Real `aiter_raw()` yields zero chunks, so **only the test doubles took this branch** |
| 1.279 | `stream=True` moved body-read failures outside the `try`, turning a mid-body upstream death into a truncated `200` — a silent `SyntaxError` in a Vite chunk rather than a retryable status |
| 1.280 | `public_proxy` forwarded the client's `Content-Length` while sending an empty body, so a probe carrying a body answered 500 |
| 1.281 | the pooled client was handed across event loops; `is_closed` says nothing about which loop its sockets belong to |
| 1.282 | module-level `asyncio.Lock()`s bind on their first **contended** acquire, so they failed only under the concurrency the single-flight was written for |
| 1.283 | a non-numeric `LEX_PROXY_REPLICAS` raised at import — in the uvicorn worker thread, killing the proxy while Streamlit kept serving |
| 1.284 | the `/static` mount ignored `--server.baseUrlPath`, silently restoring the 401 storm with the bundle present so nothing warned |
| 1.285 | the CLI pre-flight mirrored two of five import-time rules, so the SameSite raises still died in the worker thread — the failure it exists to prevent |
| 1.286 | the pre-flight's `startswith("https://")` disagreed with proxy.py's case-normalising `httpx.URL(...).scheme`, so `HTTPS://host` passed the readable check and raised later |

Two more were fixed without a scenario: the lifespan JWKS warmup was awaited, and uvicorn runs lifespan startup **before** creating the listener, so it kept port 8501 closed for up to 10s while `lex streamlit` had already pointed the browser at it (now a background task); and `_reimport_proxy_with` restored `sys.modules["lex.proxy"]` but not the `lex.proxy` **package attribute**, leaving a later `from lex import proxy` bound to a throwaway module with a different `TOKEN_STORE`.

#### 1ad follow-up 2 — scenarios 1.287–1.290: the channel the other fixes needed

Freezing the iframe `src` is what stops a renewal destroying the Streamlit session. But it also removed the only way a renewed token could **reach** the proxy: `?auth_token=` in the iframe URL. So the two halves were mutually exclusive — deliver the token and lose the state, or keep the state and let the session die at the access token's own lifetime (~5 min, Keycloak's default), with the shell holding a fresh token it had nowhere to put.

Verified directly before fixing: bootstrap with a 3-second token, wait, and the next request is a **401** even though a valid renewal is sitting in React state. The only credential the proxy would accept was `?auth_token=`, i.e. an iframe reload.

`POST /auth/adopt` is the missing third option, and it reuses rather than replaces what was already there — `_persist_jwt_to_session_if_needed`'s strictly-newer adoption, whose comment already named the frontend as the intended source.

| Scenario | Asserts |
| --- | --- |
| 1.287 | a strictly newer token POSTed from the shell is adopted, and the session then outlives the token it was bootstrapped with |
| 1.288 | a foreign `Origin`, and no `Origin` at all, are both refused — the endpoint is credentialed so it can never answer `*`, and an unset `REACT_APP_URL` must close it rather than open it |
| 1.289 | the token is still JWKS-validated: junk is 401, absent is 400. This is what stops the endpoint being a way to install arbitrary identity |
| 1.290 | the CORS preflight succeeds for the allowed origin naming POST, and is refused for any other — without it the browser never sends the request, and the failure would be invisible except as a session that quietly stops renewing |

| 1.291 | `DOMAIN_HOSTED` alone permits adoption, with no extra variable set — the reason the allowlist is derived rather than declared |
| 1.292 | `DOMAIN_HOSTED=localhost` (the development default) yields the shell's real dev origins, not a trusted `https://localhost` |

The allowlist is **derived, not declared**, and that was the point: `settings.py` refuses to start without `DOMAIN_HOSTED` whenever `DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENT` is set, and Django already builds `CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST` from it identically. A new *required* variable would have made the failure mode a dashboard that renews for five minutes and then quietly stops, with nothing in the logs — the class of bug this whole batch exists to remove.

The token travels in a request **body**, so unlike the bootstrap it never reaches the address bar, history, or a `Referer` — which also makes this strictly better than the mechanism `token_views.py` originally documented.

#### 1ad follow-up 3 — the guard that was worse than the bug

Scenario 1.270 originally asserted that the proxy **refuses to boot** when `SESSION_SECRET` is unset on an https deployment. That shipped, and immediately stopped a running instance from starting:

```
Error: SESSION_SECRET is not set, but STREAMLIT_URL/BASE_URL is https, so this
looks like a real deployment. ...
```

The reasoning behind the refusal was that degrading into the symptom is what made the original bug hard to find. That is true of a *broken* configuration and false of a *degraded* one, and this was the second kind: `lex streamlit` runs one process, so a per-process key works perfectly until the next restart, at which point users are logged out once. A dashboard that starts and loses sessions on redeploy beats one that does not start.

The durable fix was to stop needing a new variable rather than to demand one — the same shape as the `DOMAIN_HOSTED` correction in follow-up 2. `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` is generated by terraform's `random_password`, kept in state, and shipped in the `app-env-*` Secret, so it is stable across restarts and identical on every replica: exactly the property session cookies need, already present on every instance. The key is *derived* from it via HMAC with a fixed label, so a leaked cookie-signing key does not hand over Django's secret or vice versa, and the published `settings.py` fallback is explicitly excluded — deriving from that would give every lex-app instance in the world the same signing key, which is worse than a random one rather than better.

1.270 now asserts the derivation, 1.271 asserts that **no** session-secret configuration refuses to start, and 1.276/1.286 assert the CLI pre-flight warns rather than blocks. What still refuses is the set that is genuinely broken: replicas without a shared token store, and a `SameSite=None` cookie without `Secure` that browsers discard outright.
