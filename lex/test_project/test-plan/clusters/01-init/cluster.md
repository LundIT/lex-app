## 1. Init — Project Bootstrap

**What it tests:** The two CLI commands a brand-new user runs on day one:

1. **`lex setup`** — scaffolds `.env`, `.run/` (PyCharm configs), and `migrations/` in a fresh project directory
2. **`lex Init`** — applies migrations, syncs Django models to Keycloak (as Resources + Scopes), registers default roles and policies, and loads `INITIAL_DATA` if configured

If either command is broken, a new customer cannot start using the framework at all. This is the front door.

**Why first:** Every other cluster depends on a running database, a synced Keycloak realm, and loaded seed data. Without `lex setup` and `lex Init`, nothing else works.

**Fixtures needed:**
- A minimal test project directory (temp dir) with `lex_config.py`, `app.py`, and a sample model
- Mock Keycloak admin API (real HTTP boundary)
- Test JSON seed file referenced by `INITIAL_DATA`
- `SeedableItem` — simple `LexModel` used as the target of seed data

### 1a. `lex setup` — scaffolding

| # | Scenario | What We Assert |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1.1 | Fresh directory | `.env`, `.run/`, `migrations/__init__.py` created |
| 1.2 | Existing `.env` preserved | Re-running `setup` does not overwrite user's `.env` |
| 1.3 | `.run/` configs regenerated | PyCharm run configurations (`Init`, `Start`, `Streamlit`) written with correct paths |
| 1.4 | Missing project root | Clear error message, no partial scaffolding |
| 1.5 | `find_project_root` resolves correctly | Walks up to find `lex_config.py` or uses cwd |

### 1b. `lex Init` — first-run initialization

| # | Scenario | What We Assert |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1.6 | First run on empty DB | Migrations applied, tables created for all project models |
| 1.7 | Second run (idempotent) | No-op for migrations, Keycloak sync shows no drift, no errors |
| 1.8 | Adds a new model, runs again | New table created, new Keycloak resource registered with default scopes (`list`, `read`, `create`, `edit`, `delete`, `export`) |
| 1.9 | Renames a model, runs again | Keycloak resource renamed (not duplicated), old name removed |
| 1.10 | Deletes a model, runs again | Keycloak resource removed, excluded from sync list |
| 1.11 | Default roles registered | `admin`, `standard`, `view-only` roles created in Keycloak |
| 1.12 | Default scope → policy mapping | `create`/`delete` → admin only; `read`/`list` → all roles; `edit`/`export` → admin + standard |
| 1.13 | Keycloak unavailable (timeout) | Non-fatal error, clear message, local state consistent |
| 1.14 | Missing Keycloak env vars | Fails fast with actionable error naming the missing variable |
| 1.15 | Keycloak state file updated | `.keycloak_state.json` reflects current synced state |
| 1.16 | Excluded apps skipped | `legacy_data`, historical/metahistorical models, `AuditLog` not synced to Keycloak |

### 1c. `INITIAL_DATA` loading (part of `lex Init`)

| # | Scenario | What We Assert |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1.17 | Seed data loads on empty database | Records created with correct field values |
| 1.18 | Seed data skips when data already exists | No duplicates, no errors, existing data untouched |
| 1.19 | Invalid seed data format | Clear error message, no partial load |
| 1.20 | Seed data with foreign key references | Related records resolved correctly |
| 1.21 | `lex_config.py` parses | `INITIAL_DATA` path and `PROJECT_GROUPS` read correctly |
| 1.22 | Missing seed file | Skipped gracefully with a log message, `Init` still succeeds |

### 1q. Migration file completeness gate ✅

**Gap:** A framework release must never rely on customer machines to generate
missing migration files during `lex Init`; that creates downstream duplicate
migration conflicts when the missing files are later committed in a follow-up
release.

**Scenario range:** 1.147 – 1.147. **Test file:** `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1q_migration_files_complete.py`. **Type:** U. **Status:** ✅ Complete (Session 70 — June 2).

### 1s. Log-noise cleanup + lex-namespace debug control (EXC-1787) ✅

**Gap:** A customer running LEX App V2 locally (ticket EXC-1787) reported two
log-ergonomics problems. (1) urllib3's `InsecureRequestWarning` spams local logs
on every Keycloak request because TLS verification defaults off; the framework's
intent is clean logs by default, suppressed at startup with an opt-out
(`LEX_SUPPRESS_INSECURE_WARNING=False`). (2) There was no way to see the
framework's own `logger.debug(...)` without the third-party DEBUG firehose that
`LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` pulls in; `LEX_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` must raise only the `lex.*`
namespace while root stays at INFO. (3) Local startup also emitted Python warnings
(e.g. Django's "Accessing the database during app initialization" RuntimeWarning);
a blanket `LEX_SUPPRESS_WARNINGS` gate (default on) quiets these, with an opt-out.

**Scenario range:** 1.159 – 1.168. **Test file:** `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1s_log_cleanup_and_lex_debug.py`. **Type:** U. **Status:** ✅ Complete (Session 75 — June 8). Letter note: 1r is an in-flight WIP batch (lex_view embed helper), so this batch took the next free letter 1s.

### Batch 1t — `DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS` placement (production cursor crash)

`lex/lex_app/settings.py` declared `DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS = True` at **module level**, where Django ignores it — the flag is only read from the per-database config dict (`connection.settings_dict`). In deployed environments behind the `cloud-sql-proxy-...-pooling` transaction-pooling proxy, PostgreSQL server-side (named) cursors therefore stayed enabled, and every `.iterator()` query (permission filter backend, list views, exports) raised `psycopg2.OperationalError: cursor "_django_curs_..." does not exist` because the `DECLARE` and a later `FETCH` were routed to different backend connections. Deterministic per request → no reload recovered, and the calculation-log panel never loaded from the DB. **Fix:** loop over `DATABASES` after the default is resolved and set `DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS=True` on every PostgreSQL-engine alias, so `.iterator()` falls back to pooling-safe client-side reads.

| # | Scenario | What We Assert |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1.169 | Flag set in every Postgres DB config dict | each PostgreSQL alias carries `DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS: True` inside its config dict — the only place Django reads it; guards against the module-level regression |
| 1.170 | Live default connection honours the flag | `connections["default"].settings_dict` reports it True on PostgreSQL (Django defaults the key to False when absent, so the old placement surfaces here as False); engine-gated for local SQLite |

**Scenario range:** 1.169 – 1.170. **Test file:** `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1t_disable_server_side_cursors.py`. **Type:** U. **Status:** ✅ Complete (Session 78 — June 9). Source: `lex/lex_app/settings.py`.

### Batch 1u — Fast ASGI health/readiness probes ✅

**Gap:** PR #615 added a lightweight ASGI health/readiness layer so Kubernetes
liveness can return `200` without touching Django/DB, while readiness only
returns `200` once the database is reachable. A regression here either restarts
healthy pods (`/health` stops being cheap/static) or sends WebSocket/API traffic
to a pod before it can serve (`/readiness` lies ready).

| # | Scenario | What We Assert |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1.171 | Health/readiness path helpers are disjoint | `/health` and `/api/health` are fast liveness only; `/readiness` and `/api/readiness` are DB-aware readiness only |
| 1.172 | Fast health ASGI app drains request body and returns static payload | multi-message request body is consumed; response is `200` with `{"status": "Healthy :)"}` and no-store headers |
| 1.173 | Readiness reflects DB availability | patched DB-ready seam returns `200 {"status":"ready"}`; DB-unavailable returns `503 {"status":"not-ready","reason":"database-unavailable"}` |
| 1.174 | Top-level ASGI app short-circuits probe paths | `/health` and `/readiness` call their lightweight ASGI apps and do not invoke Django |
| 1.175 | Non-probe HTTP delegates to Django | arbitrary application paths bypass health shortcuts and reach `django_asgi_app` |

**Scenario range:** 1.171 – 1.175. **Test file:** `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1u_fast_health_asgi.py`. **Type:** U. **Status:** ✅ Complete (Session 81 — June 18). Sources: `lex/lex_app/fast_health.py`, `lex/lex_app/asgi.py`.

### 1v. `TIME_ZONE`↔`USE_TZ` coupling — `django_celery_beat` DatabaseScheduler correctness

`django_celery_beat`'s `DatabaseScheduler` reads naive datetimes through
`celery.utils.time.maybe_make_aware`, which **hardcodes naive == UTC**
(`ModelEntry.is_due` and `clocked.__init__`). The framework runs two beat
schedules through it: the recovery sweep (an `IntervalSchedule`) and future
history edits (a one-off `ClockedSchedule` fired at `History.valid_from`, see
`bitemporal_signals._schedule_future_activation`). Under `USE_TZ=False` (the
deliberate GCP/default production setting) Django stores **naive Berlin
wall-clock**, so if `TIME_ZONE` were a non-UTC zone beat would misread every
stored timestamp by the UTC offset — the interval sweep never becomes due and
clocked activations fire 1–2h late (DST-dependent). `settings.py` therefore
pins `TIME_ZONE = "Europe/Berlin" if USE_TZ else "UTC"`: under `USE_TZ=False`
the naive frame Django writes **is** real UTC; under `USE_TZ=True` datetimes
are tz-aware so the display zone stays free. Decoupling the two silently breaks
every beat-driven feature on a `USE_TZ=False` deployment.

| # | Scenario | What We Assert |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1.179 | `USE_TZ=False` forces UTC | when `settings.USE_TZ` is False, `settings.TIME_ZONE == "UTC"` so beat's naive-as-UTC read is correct; under `USE_TZ=True` a display zone is still configured |
| 1.180 | Django's naive frame matches beat's assumption | under `USE_TZ=False`, `timezone.now()` is naive and within seconds of real UTC, so a stored timestamp round-trips through `maybe_make_aware` unchanged |
| 1.181 | Recovery `IntervalSchedule` is due in the live frame | replicating `ModelEntry.is_due` (`maybe_make_aware(last_run_at).astimezone(app.timezone)`): just-ran → not due with `next ≤ interval`; 3×-overdue → due (the original stuck-sweep symptom) |
| 1.182 | Future-edit `ClockedSchedule` fires at `valid_from` | `clocked(now+30s)` is ~30s away (not hours) and not due; a past target is due immediately — the exact path future history edits take under Celery |
| 1.183 | Non-UTC naive storage is misread by the offset (regression rationale) | the same instant stored naive-UTC round-trips exactly through beat's reader, while naive-Berlin is misread by ≥3600s — the skew the coupling eliminates |

**Scenario range:** 1.179 – 1.183. **Test file:** `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1v_scheduler_tz_invariant.py`. **Type:** U. **Status:** ✅ Complete (Session 84 — June 26). Source: `lex/lex_app/settings.py` (USE_TZ↔TIME_ZONE coupling); guards the `django_celery_beat` `is_due` path it must keep correct.

---

### 1w. `LEX_TASK_RECOVERY_ENABLED` defaults OFF — stuck calc resets on restart

**What it tests:** the recovery master switch defaults to **off**, so the startup sweep (`_handle_calculation_model_reset`) stays in blind-abort mode and a stuck `IN_PROGRESS` calculation is reset to `ABORTED` on the next server restart when no recovery-supervisor pod is running (local dev, CI, un-provisioned deploys). The liveness-aware sweep otherwise skips rows a *tracked* recovery task owns — but that ownership record lingers in Redis across a restart, so without a running supervisor the row is orphaned `IN_PROGRESS` forever. The flag gates only the recovery registry/heartbeat/supervisor + the sweep skip-set; it never touches calculation dispatch, so a calculation that dispatches sub-calculations is unaffected either way.

| Scenario | Title | Asserts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.184 | Env unset ⟹ off | with `LEX_TASK_RECOVERY_ENABLED` absent, `settings.LEX_TASK_RECOVERY_ENABLED is False` — the startup sweep blind-aborts stuck rows on restart |
| 1.185 | Explicit `=true` opts in | `LEX_TASK_RECOVERY_ENABLED=true` ⟹ `True`, so a deployment running the supervisor pod keeps its dead-worker requeue behaviour |
| 1.186 | Explicit off + case-insensitive | `=false` ⟹ `False`; `=TRUE` ⟹ `True` (the `.lower() == "true"` parse is casing-tolerant) |

**Scenario range:** 1.184 – 1.186. **Test file:** `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1w_recovery_default_deployment_target.py`. **Type:** U. **Status:** ✅ Complete (Session 90 — July 1). Source: `lex/lex_app/settings.py` (`LEX_TASK_RECOVERY_ENABLED` default `true` → `false`). Nested-dispatch untouched — 7j/7q/8ab all pass.

---

### 1y. IDE-aware setup run configurations

`lex setup` generates runnable project commands for the IDE that invoked it.
VS Code integrated terminals are identified from `TERM_PROGRAM`/`VSCODE_*`
markers; PyCharm and compatible JetBrains terminals are identified from their
host/terminal markers. No marker is universal, and inherited markers can
conflict, so ambiguous environments deliberately generate both `.run/*.run.xml`
and `.vscode/launch.json`.

The VS Code launch set runs `python -m lex` through `debugpy`, uses the workspace
root as `cwd`, loads `.env`, carries the command-specific environment, and maps
PyCharm's Celery worker-count macro to a VS Code `promptString`. Generated
entries are namespaced with `LEX:` and merged into existing JSON/JSONC so setup
does not remove user launch configurations.

| # | Scenario | What We Assert |
|---|----------|----------------|
| 1.203 | VS Code marker | only `.vscode/launch.json` is newly generated and reported |
| 1.204 | PyCharm marker | only `.run/*.run.xml` is newly generated and reported |
| 1.205 | No IDE marker | both IDE formats are generated as the safe fallback |
| 1.206 | Conflicting IDE markers | detection does not guess; both formats are generated |
| 1.207 | Cross-IDE parity | all ten commands retain module, args, env, cwd, `.env`, terminal, and worker prompt semantics |
| 1.208 | Existing JSONC launch file | custom configurations and inputs survive the LEX merge |
| 1.209 | Repeated setup | launch JSON is byte-identical with no duplicate configurations or prompts |
| 1.210 | Standalone generator | auto-detection is reused and the console wrapper exits successfully |

**Scenario range:** 1.203 – 1.210. **Test file:** `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1y_ide_run_configs.py`. **Type:** U. **Status:** ✅ Complete (July 23). Sources: `generate_pycharm_configs.py`, `lex/bin/lex.py`, `pyproject.toml`.

### 1z. Streamlit auth proxy — iframe re-auth breakout (refused-to-connect fix)

**What it tests:** the Streamlit dashboard is embedded in an `<iframe>`. When the auth proxy (`lex/proxy.py`) has no valid identity it must re-authenticate — but Keycloak's login page is served with `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` / `Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self'` and cannot render inside a frame, so redirecting the iframe to the IdP makes the browser show "auth.&lt;host&gt; refused to connect". The proxy detects a framed document load (`Sec-Fetch-Dest: iframe`/`frame`) and breaks out to a top-level login instead, while leaving the ordinary top-level redirect and the API 401 untouched.

| Scenario | Title | Asserts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.211 | iframe → breakout, not IdP redirect | an unauthenticated `Sec-Fetch-Dest: iframe` document load returns a 401 HTML breakout (auto top-nav + `postMessage` + `target="_top"` link to the absolute `/auth/login`), never a `RedirectResponse` into the IdP |
| 1.212 | `<frame>` breaks out too | `Sec-Fetch-Dest: frame` is treated the same as `iframe` — both are framed contexts |
| 1.213 | top-level HTML still redirects | `Sec-Fetch-Dest: document` with `Accept: text/html` still redirects to `/auth/login` (a top-level page can render the IdP) |
| 1.214 | missing `Sec-Fetch-*` keeps redirect | a client that omits `Sec-Fetch-*` falls back to the pre-existing redirect (breakout only fires on a positively-identified frame) |
| 1.215 | non-HTML → 401 JSON | an XHR/API request (`Accept: application/json`) gets `{"error": "Authentication required"}` at 401, not a redirect or HTML |
| 1.216 | detector is case-insensitive + scoped | `_is_iframe_document_request` matches `iframe`/`FRAME`; `document` and a missing header are not framed |

**Scenario range:** 1.211 – 1.216. **Test file:** `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1z_proxy_iframe_breakout.py`. **Type:** U. **Status:** ✅ Complete (2026-07-21). Source: `lex/proxy.py` (`_unauthenticated_response`, `_is_iframe_document_request`). Follow-up (separate change): give the embedded `auth_token` path a refresh token so the proxy renews silently instead of forcing re-login at the 4h SSO cap.

---

### 1aa. Embedded Streamlit token renewal ✅

**What it tests:** that the embedded Streamlit auth flow can renew itself — the token endpoint publishes when to renew, and the proxy adopts a renewed token instead of keeping the older one.

**Why a regression matters:** silent. Without a published expiry the caller has nothing to schedule against; if the proxy keeps the older token, every renewal is discarded and the session still dies at the original expiry — no error anywhere, just a user sent back to the login page mid-work.

**Scenario range:** 1.217 – 1.222. **Test file:** `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1aa_embedded_token_renewal.py`. **Type:** U. **Status:** ✅ 6 pass.

---

### 1ab. Ignored client-role self-cleanup (`client-admin` platform role, LEX-5) ✅

**What it tests:** `lex init` builds tenant authz from every role found on the Keycloak client; roles in `IGNORED_CLIENT_ROLES` get no `Policy - <role>`. The sync only ever ADDS policies via Keycloak's import endpoint — it never deletes an entry just because it's missing from the re-imported payload — so a policy minted by an older lex-app for a role that later became ignored (here: the new platform-internal `client-admin` role, replacing the abandoned `release-manager`) would persist forever without an explicit cleanup step.

**Why a regression matters:** a stale `Policy - client-admin` silently grants tenant-app authorization to a role that is meant to be platform-internal only — exactly the authorization leak LEX-5 exists to close.

| Scenario | Title | Asserts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.223 | ignore-set contents | `client-admin` is in `IGNORED_CLIENT_ROLES`; the superseded `release-manager` is not |
| 1.224 | stale policy removed from config | a pre-existing `Policy - client-admin` is dropped from `auth_config['policies']` |
| 1.225 | reference detached from permission | a permission's `config.applyPolicies` has `Policy - client-admin` removed, other applied policies survive in order |
| 1.226 | no-op when nothing stale | a config with no ignored-role policy is left byte-for-byte unchanged |
| 1.227 | live delete by id | a live `Policy - client-admin` found via `get_client_authz_policies` is deleted via `delete_client_authz_policy` using its id |
| 1.228 | no-op when nothing live | no matching live policy → `delete_client_authz_policy` is never called |
| 1.229 | missing-id fail-fast | a matching live policy record without an `id` raises `CommandError` (mirrors `delete_resources_individual`'s permission-id check) |

**Scenario range:** 1.223 – 1.229. **Test file:** `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1ab_ignored_role_policy_cleanup.py`. **Type:** U. **Status:** ✅ 7 pass. Source: `lex/lex_app/management/commands/init.py` (`IGNORED_CLIENT_ROLES`, `strip_ignored_role_policies`, `delete_stale_ignored_role_policies`). Design: `local_wiki/projects/admin-role-separation-5/README.md`. The live-delete-after-import ordering (so Keycloak's referential-integrity check on the policy delete passes) is not verified against a live Keycloak instance.

### 1ac. Streamlit session survival across an idle period ✅

**What it tests:** that a Streamlit dashboard left open and idle keeps working. Streamlit reads request headers off the *WebSocket handshake* (`st.context.headers` resolves the session's client), so every credential the proxy injects is a snapshot taken once, when the socket opened — and the socket then stays open for hours. Renewal therefore has to come from a channel that is still live: the proxy's `/auth/token`, which owns the refresh token and remains the only component allowed to spend it.

**Why a regression matters:** it is what the user sees. Before this batch an idle tab died on the access token's own lifetime and reported "Authentication Error: Missing user information" — a message about identity headers that were in fact present, on a page that could not recover, because the next rerun re-read the same frozen headers and invalidated again.

| Scenario | Title | Asserts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.230 | `/auth/token` needs the internal secret | a valid session cookie alone gets a 403 — page script can `fetch` with credentials, so the HttpOnly cookie must not be enough to exfiltrate a bearer token |
| 1.231 | the pull returns a token valid *now* | the response carries the refreshed token and its expiry, not the stale stored copy |
| 1.232 | the refresh token is never handed out | absent from the response — two components rotating it is the race the pull channel exists to avoid |
| 1.233 | an unrenewable session is a 401 | the caller must distinguish "renewed" from "sign in again" |
| 1.234 | session outranks the `st_access` cookie (HTTP) | forwarded as session auth *with* the refresh token; the cookie is set on every login, so consulting it first classified a fresh login as unrenewable `jwt` |
| 1.235 | an explicit `auth_token` still wins | the embedded renewal handoff keeps its precedence over the session |
| 1.246 | the WS handshake carries the renewable credential | the one moment a long-lived connection is handed anything must hand it the session's refresh token |
| 1.236 | a stale handshake token never replaces a renewed one | adopting on inequality reverted every renewal on the next rerun |
| 1.237 | a genuinely newer handshake token is adopted | a reconnect or a re-sourced iframe is a legitimate renewal path |
| 1.238 | renewal pulls from the proxy | the refresh token in session state stays untouched while the proxy answers |
| 1.239 | fallback when no proxy answers | the refresh token is spent only then — no second writer to race |
| 1.240 | identity survives an unrenewable token | the user stays authenticated and identified, flagged only as needing renewal |
| 1.241 | permissions are kept when Keycloak fails | a failed UMA lookup must not silently demote the user to no access |
| 1.242 | the refresher runs for session auth too | "the proxy handles it" meant nobody did — the proxy only delivers at handshake time |
| 1.243 | the refresher stops with the session | closing a tab sets no session-state flag, so a flag-only refresher outlived every abandoned session |
| 1.244 | a transient failure stays invisible | a proxy restart must not put a re-auth notice in front of someone reading a chart |
| 1.245 | a persistent failure surfaces recovery | past the grace window the cause is SSO max lifetime or a revoked session; a successful renewal clears the stamp |

**Scenario range:** 1.230 – 1.246. **Test file:** `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1ac_streamlit_session_survival.py`. **Type:** U. **Status:** ✅ 17 pass.

### 1ad. Streamlit's asset bundle served ungated, and session durability ✅

**What it tests:** that loading a Streamlit dashboard is fast, quiet, and survives its own credential. Streamlit's frontend is code-split — 1.61 ships 365 JS chunks and names 107 of them in eager `<link rel="modulepreload">` tags — and the proxy in front of it authenticated every request through one catch-all route whose deny ran before it looked at the path. The bundle is therefore served by the proxy itself and never gated: it is package content from the installed wheel, identical for every install, with no tenant data and no identity. Everything else on the same host is the opposite, so half these scenarios exist to hold that line.

**Why a regression matters:** it is all three reports customers filed. Gate the bundle again and a credential-less moment is a hundred 401s, a cold start four times heavier than it needs to be, and — the one they saw — `TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module`, because Vite reports an HTTP failure on a dynamic `import()` as a type error. Widen the public allowlist by one path instead, and a dashboard becomes readable by anyone who knows the URL.

| Scenario | Title | Asserts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.247 | a chunk needs no credential | a hashed JS chunk returns 200 with no cookie, no `auth_token`, no `Authorization` |
| 1.248 | cache headers cut both ways | content-addressed files are `immutable` for a year; `manifest.json` is `no-cache` — a stale manifest names dead hashes and causes the same TypeErrors from a different direction |
| 1.249 | the bundle is compressed | a gzip-accepting client gets `Content-Encoding: gzip`, and compression actually reduces the bytes |
| 1.250 | hashes cannot drift | the served directory is exactly `streamlit.file_util.get_static_dir()`, and holds the `index.html` that names the hashes |
| 1.251 | a missing bundle degrades | an unlocatable bundle adds no routes and raises nothing — a slow authenticated `/static` beats an app that will not boot |
| 1.252 | bootstrap endpoints are public | `/_stcore/health` and `/_stcore/host-config` reach the upstream with no credential (probes have no session; host-config is read before the WebSocket exists) |
| 1.253 | the public path asserts no identity | none of the `X-Streamlit-User-*` / `X-Forwarded-User` headers are attached, so nothing downstream can read an anonymous probe as a signed-in user |
| 1.254 | the boundary holds | `/`, `/media/**`, `/_stcore/upload_file` and an arbitrary app route all still 401 |
| 1.255 | the socket is not public | an unauthenticated upgrade to `/_stcore/stream` is closed, not accepted |
| 1.256 | the upstream client is pooled | four sequential requests share one client, not one each |
| 1.257 | `Content-Encoding` survives | an encoded upstream body is relayed still encoded, so the saving is not thrown away |
| 1.258 | every cookie survives | two upstream `Set-Cookie` headers both reach the client — losing Streamlit's XSRF cookie breaks the handshake |
| 1.259 | the referrer is not leaked | proxied responses carry `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`; the document URL holds a JWT |
| 1.260 | a failed refresh keeps its keys | stale keys survive an unreachable Keycloak, and the retry is deferred — returning `None` used to reject every token in the cluster |
| 1.261 | cold cache plus failure | no keys reported, and nothing raised (a raise here would become a 500 instead of an actionable 401) |
| 1.262 | one fetch, not a hundred | 25 concurrent callers share a single blocking fetch |
| 1.263 | reading keys never fetches | a cold cache reads as empty rather than blocking the event loop |
| 1.264 | you come back where you were | `auth_callback` honours the stashed `next` instead of redirecting to `/` |
| 1.265 | a hostile `next` is refused | `//host`, `https://host`, `http://host`, `/\host`, `\\host`, a bare host and `javascript:` are all rejected; same-origin paths survive intact |
| 1.266 | the session is not trusted | an off-origin path already in the session still falls back to `/` — validating only on entry is how open redirects survive review |
| 1.267 | the breakout can recover | the iframe recovery page's sign-in link is absolute, `target="_top"`, and carries the view being recovered |
| 1.268 | stripping keeps the destination | removing `auth_token` preserves `model`, `pk` and the rest — dropping them would trade one bug for another |
| 1.269 | only documents are redirected | `document` and `iframe` count; `empty` and `script` do not, so an XHR is served rather than 303'd |
| 1.270 | the session key is derived, not demanded | `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY` yields a durable cookie key, and is not reused verbatim |
| 1.271 | no configuration refuses to start | explicit secret, derivable secret, neither, and the published default all boot; only the first two are durable |
| 1.272 | replicas need a shared store | `LEX_PROXY_REPLICAS>1` without Redis raises; with Redis it boots |
| 1.273 | an unusable cookie is refused | `SameSite=None` without `Secure` raises (browsers discard such cookies outright), and so does a typo |
| 1.274 | cross-site frames get a cookie | https defaults to `SameSite=None`; local http stays `lax` |
| 1.275 | the session window outlasts a login | `--server.disconnectedSessionTTL` is passed and exceeds Streamlit's 120s default |
| 1.276 | the CLI reports without blocking | the pre-flight warns about an undurable session key rather than refusing to start |

**Scenario range:** 1.247 – 1.292. **Test file:** `lex/test_project/tests/init/test_1ad_proxy_assets_and_session_durability.py`. **Type:** U. **Status:** ✅ 46 pass, 33 subtests. **27 of the first 30 fail against the pre-fix tree**; 1.254, 1.255 and 1.271 pass by design as guards. Measured and explicitly not a cause: JWT validation at 0.045 ms/request — 16 ms across all 365 chunks. Recorded **BUG-029** (a pre-existing cluster-1 flake) while running this batch.

| Scenario | Title | Asserts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.277 | the strip hands over every credential | the `auth_token` redirect re-issues `st_access`, so it never delivers fewer credentials than the response it replaces |
| 1.278 | a bodiless response yields nothing | a 304 relays with no body chunk — `b""` would make GZip attach a body to it |
| 1.279 | a mid-body failure is not a truncated 200 | the error propagates, so the browser sees a network error rather than a half-delivered chunk |
| 1.280 | a probe with a body is not a 500 | `Content-Length` is never forwarded; httpx recomputes it from the real body |
| 1.281 | the pooled client is per event loop | two successive loops get different clients |
| 1.282 | the single-flight lock is per event loop | contended acquisition on a second loop does not raise |
| 1.283 | a malformed integer setting does not stop the proxy | `LEX_PROXY_REPLICAS=auto` warns and defaults to 1 |
| 1.284 | the bundle follows `baseUrlPath` | the mount moves to `/app/static`, and is not also left at `/static` |
| 1.285 | the pre-flight mirrors the cookie rules | `SameSite=none` without `Secure`, and an invalid value, both fail on the main thread |
| 1.286 | the https test agrees on both sides | `HTTPS://host` is recognised as a deployment by the CLI, as it is by the proxy |

**Scenarios 1.277 – 1.286** were added after an adversarial review of the first pass. All ten defects they pin lived in the *new* code, and four would have reproduced one of the three original symptoms by a different route — which is the argument for reviewing a fix as hard as the bug.

| Scenario | Title | Asserts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1.287 | renewal reaches the proxy without an iframe reload | a newer token POSTed to `/auth/adopt` is adopted, and the session outlives its bootstrap token |
| 1.288 | only the configured frontend may adopt | a foreign `Origin` and a missing one are both 403 |
| 1.289 | adoption still validates | an unverifiable token is 401, an absent one 400 |
| 1.290 | the preflight is answerable and scoped | 204 naming POST for the allowed origin, 403 for any other |
| 1.291 | the allowlist derives from the instance hostname | `DOMAIN_HOSTED` alone permits adoption, and never `*` |
| 1.292 | the localhost default is not promoted | `DOMAIN_HOSTED=localhost` trusts the shell's dev ports, not `https://localhost` |

**Scenarios 1.287 – 1.290** exist because the earlier fixes created the gap between them: freezing the iframe `src` protects the Streamlit session but removed the only channel a renewed token had. Verified before fixing — an embedded session 401s past its bootstrap token's expiry with a valid renewal sitting unused in the shell.
