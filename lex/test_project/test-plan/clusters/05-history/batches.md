| Type | I |
| Files covered | `core/services/Bitemporal.py`, `core/services/bitemporal_signals.py`, `core/services/StandardHistory.py`, `core/services/MetaHistory.py`, `process_admin/utils/bitemporal_sync.py` |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/history/test_5e_bitemporal_services.py` |
| Test classes | `TestBitemporalCore` (intervals, valid_from/to chaining), `TestBitemporalSignals` (pre_save → row close + new row), `TestStandardHistory` (non-bitemporal branch), `TestMetaHistory` (cross-model linking), `TestBitemporalSync` (legacy → bitemporal migration) |

### Batch 5m — Edit-time correctness + as_of time-travel round trip ✅ (1 xfail gates BUG-026)

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 5.98 – 5.103 |
| Type | E |
| Files covered | `api/utils/temporal.py` (`parse_as_of_datetime`), `core/services/Bitemporal.py` (`get_queryset_as_of`), `api/views/model_entries/History.py` (`?as_of` branch), `core/models/LexModel.py` (`lex_datetime_now` / `edited_at`) |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/history/test_5m_asof_edit_time.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster05m_AsOfEditTime` |
| Fixtures | reuses `HistSimpleItem` |
| Est. tests | 7 |
| Coverage gain | pins the full timestamp chain end to end (stamp → serialize → parse → compare) |
| Prereqs | BUG-025 fix (Z-serialized datetimes) |
| Status | ✅ Complete — 5 pass / 1 xfail(strict) |
| Note | Customer concern 2026-07-14 ("we rely on the as_of mechanism"). 5.98 edited_at is the true edit instant and its serialized form denotes the same instant; 5.99 as_of before the edit returns exactly the pre-edit snapshot (values included); 5.100 as_of now knows both versions, latest current; 5.101 (xfail strict, **BUG-026**) anchoring as_of on the record's own serialized edited_at must land on the post-edit side — fails today because `edited_at` and `valid_from`/`sys_from` come from separate clock reads (~ms gap). Fix design + the `_history_date` trap are documented in the BUG-026 row. Extension (2026-07-14, customer list-time-travel report): 5.102 the LIST endpoint (`?as_of=`, the grid's surface) shows pre-edit values at a pre-edit UTC anchor and current values at now; 5.103 naive as_of == UTC by contract, and an offset-aware local anchor for the same instant lands identically — pinning the backend as correct while the frontend's naive-local anchors (BUG-F-022) were the real culprit. |

### Batch 5n — Activation catch-up (reconcile pass) ✅

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario range | 5.104 – 5.110 |
| Type | E |
| Files covered | `lex/core/services/activation_reconcile.py` (new), `lex/lex_app/settings.py` (4 `LEX_ACTIVATION_RECONCILE_*` knobs), `lex/lex_app/apps.py` (startup wiring, gated to the served backend) |
| Test file | `lex/test_project/tests/history/test_5n_activation_reconcile.py` |
| Test classes | `TestCluster05n_ActivationReconcile` |
| Fixtures | `HistSimpleItem` (shared with 5l) |
| Est. tests | 7 |
| Status | ✅ Complete — 7 pass / 0 fail |
| Note | Consumer side of the contract 5l covers on the producer side. Two real defects were caught by these tests while writing them: (1) `activate_history_version` reports failure by **return value**, not by raising, so treating a clean return as success counted activations that never happened — 5.104 caught it; (2) `@lex_shared_task` wraps that return as `(result, args)`, so the status string has to be unwrapped, and `_outcome_of` degrades to "not success" rather than indexing blindly, so a future change to the decorator causes a retry rather than a silent drop. |
| Follow-up | 5.110 added after review: the loop is a long-lived thread doing ORM work, and Django only closes connections on `request_finished`. Without `close_old_connections` around each pass the thread holds one connection for the life of the pod, so a Postgres restart or failover ends catch-up permanently while logging an error every interval. |
