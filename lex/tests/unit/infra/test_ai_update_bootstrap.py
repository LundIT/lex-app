"""Guards the one thing `lex ai-update` still does inside lex-app.

The risk model: ``lex_mcp.ai_update`` binds its migration ladder at import time.
A process that starts on lex-mcp-local version N therefore iterates version N's
steps no matter what pip installs underneath it -- so a run that upgraded the
package in-process and then kept going would apply the *old* ladder and exit 0,
leaving the customer a release behind with nothing to show for it. That is why
the upgrade and the migrations are two processes, and it is the only reason the
bootstrap exists.

The failure is invisible from outside: same command, same exit code, same
"update complete". These tests pin the ordering and the handoff, because nothing
downstream would notice if either quietly went away.

No network and no pip: the runner is a stub, so the assertions are about the
commands lex-app decides to issue.
